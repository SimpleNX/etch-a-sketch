# etch-a-sketch
Etch-A-Sketch!

## What the project is about
The above page creates a **etch-a-sketch** to some extent, where you can create a 
$N*N$ sized grid, and play around!

## What have I learnt and implemented
I have learnt how to make HTML elements and place them in the DOM from inside of Javascript.
Adding event listeners to buttons, using bubbling to listen to events and styling the elements
also from inside of Javascript.
